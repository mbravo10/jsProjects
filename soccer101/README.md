# Social Media application for Soccer fans to connect with eachother

## Created using MERN stack application as well as using Redux to manage state information. I am currently still working on this project and will be used to develop a more sophisticated application. 

` Deliverables `

- Used bootstrap framework for user interface (web page) layout and design using React
- Provided a functionality for user signup
- Provided authentication service or a functionality for users to login
- Used a SoccerAPI to get teams. Will further extend functionality to see more soccer information
